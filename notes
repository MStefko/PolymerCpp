What do we have:
 - int numPaths
 		number of paths that have to be simulated for each
 		parameter combination

 - vector<double> pathLength - length of numPaths
 		length of each path in genomic length
 		number of base pairs in walk

 - double linDensity - number of base pairs per unit length

 - double persisLength - parameter of chain in units of unit length

 - double segConvFactor - conversion between user units and path segments

 - double locPrecision - bumping the chain

All these are passed to the Collector. This collector then creates
a Path instance for each linDensity - persisLength (- linkDiameter) combination.

This chain then does a simulation of numPaths chains with parameters of
linDensity, persisLength, segConvFactor and a single member of pathLength.

Each of these simulations then creates a RgDict, where results of the simulation
and parameters of the simulation are kept.

The Path then returns a RgDict to the Collector.
Collector saves this information.
