# PolymerCpp

3D wormlike chain generator for Python and written in C++.

PolymerCpp is a small program for generating three-dimensional
wormlike chains (WLC), a common and relatively simple model in polymer
physics. A WLC describes a semi-flexible polymer, i.e. one that is
rigid over short length scales and flexible over long ones. The
characteristic length scale that separates these two regimes is known
as the persistence length.

PolymerCpp provides a number of Python functions that exposes the C++
routines for generating 3D WLCs, including

1. infinitesimally thin WLCs
2. self-avoiding WLCs

PolymerCpp was written by `Marcel Stefko

Biophysics <http://leb.epfl.ch/>`_ for modeling DNA.
